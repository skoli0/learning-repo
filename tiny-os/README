This is a tiny little bare metal OS written in assembly language which runs on x86 platform (QEMU).

In order to run it we need development toolchain (compiler etc.), QEMU PC emulator and 
the NASM assembler, which converts assembly language into raw machine code executable files.
You don't need to worry about this, there's a shell script, build.sh. You just have to run it
in Ubuntu VM and you will see a tiny little OS running in QEMU PC Emulator.
